# Jakarte EE Demo with Python

This example project demonstrates:
* Using CDI to inject the GraalVM context
* Using CDI interceptors to kill run-away scripts
* Passing JPA instances for Python code to manipulate from an EJB. Changes to entities made in the python code are seamlessly synced with the database.
